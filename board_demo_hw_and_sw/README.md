# Demo HW & SW

Text

Following pins are not used in the demo:

- J3_32_UART_RX &ndash; serial receive pin from the USB-to-UART chip

- J3_46 and J3_47 – these are analog input pins XADC_VP/VN

- J3_50 and J3_51 – these are temperature-sensing diode pins not usable by PL (see  [UG475](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug475_7Series_Pkg_Pinout.pdf), Table1-12)

- Following pins are not available when using MicroZed 7010, because respective Zynq pins simply not don't exist on the 7010 chip:

- - J3_26
  
  - J3_42..45
  
  - J3_48..49
  
  - J3_52
  
  - J4_18..19
