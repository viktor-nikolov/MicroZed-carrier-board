# Custom symbols and footprints

I must create several custom symbols and footprints. I converted some footprints available online into KiCad. There are also footprints I copied from standard KiCad footprint library, but I had to change numbering of pads.

In KiCad you will see these symbols/footprints belonging to library "Viktor" (which is a library on my computer, not published on GitHub).

Before publishing the files on GitHub I exported all symbols and footprints used in the project into libraries placed in this folder. You can use symbols/footprints from these libraries in your project.

However I decided not to reassign symbols/footprints from library "Viktor" to the newly exported libraries in order to avoid creating errors in the PCB design.
