# KiCad design files and production files

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I designed the board from the very beginning with intention to manufacture it using [JLCPCB Manufacturing and Assembly](https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/pcb-assembly-capabilities). (I'm not affiliated with JLCPCB in any way. I'm just their customer. :smiley:). The production files in this repository are ready for ordering manufacturing and assembly from JLCPCB. 
> 
> Manufacture of this board is not exactly cheap. Production of the final revision of the board (2 assembled boards + 3 spare PCBs) cost me $194 + shipping costs. (However you can save $33 if you exclude the [50 MHz oscillator X1](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/Xtaltq-NT0503DH3I507BN50/C2920832) from the assembly.)
> 
> My selection of parts was dictated by availability of suitable parts in the [JLCPCB Assembly Parts Library](http://jlcpcb.com/parts).
> 
> Some parts are very small and have pads on the bottom. You would need a reflow oven or a hot plate for DYI assembly.

I designed the board in [KiCad 7.0](https://www.kicad.org/).
